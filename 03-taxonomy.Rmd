# Taxonomic Analysis

Taxonomic analysis - taxa barplots
```{bash}
$ qiime taxa barplot \
--i-table DADA2_denoising_output/table.qza \
--i-taxonomy taxonomy/classified_rep_seqs.qza \
--m-metadata-file metadata.txt \
--o-visualization taxonomy/taxa_barplots.qzv
```


This provides taxonomic barplots which I can then download as SVG (also allows for download as csv..which means I can then do as a LefSE plot)
Downloaded csvs and have placed in fig/taxa_barplots/ folder
