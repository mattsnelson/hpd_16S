# Introduction {#intro}

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.


This anlaysis was coducted using QIIME 2020.2. First step, download the yml file and then use it to create a conda environment for the install. 

```{bash}
wget https://data.qiime2.org/distro/core/qiime2-2020.2-py36-linux-conda.yml
conda env create -n qiime2-2020.2 --file qiime2-2020.2-py36-linux-conda.yml
```

Then activate the conda environment  

```{bash}
source activate qiime2-2020.2
```





Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
